# Electron Eon

## 1.0 Project Description

The project created as a part of the personal portfolio to demonstrate the skill of web development and deployment technologies.

This project is created with minimum e-commerce functionalities to demonstrate a full stack web built with PostgreSQL database, Spring Boot API server backend, and React SPA frontend. Deployment technologies demonstrated include Docker, AWS, Terraform, web server configuration and DNS configuration.

## 2.0 Usage

Note that the instructions below would require more manual work and are more prone to error than using Docker Compose, as outlined in the `README.md` in the project root directory, to run this full stack web app.

### 2.1 Prerequisite

1. PostgreSQL client installed (on Windows, you may also need to [set up several environment variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EBkVzIBnoc))
2. Java Development Kit 21+ such as [Eclipse Temurinâ„¢ 21.0.4+7-LTS](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jdk&os=any)
3. IDE for Java such as IntelliJ Community Edition
4. IDE for JavaScript such as VS Code

### 2.2 Steps without Docker Compose

1. Clone the repo and resolve Maven dependencies as needed:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mg86837242/electron-eon.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `api-server` directory, then create `application.properties` based on `application.properties.example:

   ```bash
   cd api-server
   cp src/main/resources/application.properties.example src/main/resources/application.properties
   ```

   Modify the following properties to match your [PostgreSQL credentials to connect to you local database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html):

   ```
   # application.properties
   spring.datasource.username=********
   spring.datasource.password=********
   ```

3. Follow the instructions of `src/main/resources/certs/README.md` to create and set up keys for JWT authentication.

4. Start the Spring Boot application `src/main/java/dev/sy/ElectronEonApplication.java` by using an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ Community Edition).

5. Navigate to the `client` directory, open up another terminal or another IDE (e.g., VS Code), then install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the front-end server and follow the Vite prompts in the terminal to view the app in the browser

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 3.0 Overview of Technology Stack

- Database Management System: PostgreSQL
  - Reason: PostgreSQL is both free and easy to set up (especially in Linux
    system). In addition, the developer is familiar with this database
    management system. Due to the project's tight deadline, both ease of use and
    familiarity hold significant value.
- Server: Spring Framework including Spring Data, Spring Web, Spring Security
  with JWT, etc.
  - Programming language: Java
  - Reason: Using Java makes it easy to adhere to SOLID and OO design
    principles, which are among the technical requirements of this project.
    Additionally, the developer is familiar with Java for backend
    development.
- Client: SPA by using React and its sub-libraries, Vite for front end
  development server and bundler, MUI for component library, etc.
  - Programming language: JavaScript, JSX
  - Reason: Setting up an SPA is easy. Furthermore, the developer is familiar
    with this type of web architecture. Given the tight deadline for this
    project, both ease of use and familiarity are highly valued.

## 6.0 Sprint Retrospectives

- 29 Apr - 30 Apr
  - What went well?: project management documentation, project bootstrapping,
    and database design
  - What went wrong?: time-consuming process of configuring and debugging
    JPA, confusion between model and ORM layers, and unclear file structure
    for model and ORM layers
    - What changes can I make?: looking for examples
- 2 May - 3 May
  - What went well?: coding models and DAOs, and testing by using sample
    data and scripts
  - What went wrong?: time-consuming process of writing Hibernate entity
    operations without the help of Spring Data, and laborious unit testing
    procedure because the EntityManager is application-managed rather than
    container-managed
  - What changes can I make?: relying on Dependency Injection for ease of
    testing
- 6 May - 7 May
  - What went well?: bootstrapping Spring Boot project, and porting the
    code from the old project to the new one, which is facilitated by
    utilizing the DAO to manage different implementations of data access
  - What went wrong?: configuring Spring Data
  - What changes can I make? not wasting time on the Hibernate entity manager approach and DAO, since JpaRepository can replace the functionalities of DAO
- 8 May - 9 May
  - What went well?: coding stubs and error handling
  - What went wrong?: authorization
  - What changes can I make? nothing
- 10 May - 13 May
  - What went well?: authorization by utilizing token mechanics
  - What went wrong?: modeling response
  - What changes can I make? using JPA projections
- 14 May - 15 May
  - What went well?: state management
  - What went wrong?: project configuration, authentication and authorization
  - What changes can I make? focusing on the core business logics
- 16 May - 17 May
  - What went well?: styling
  - What went wrong?: protected routes
  - What changes can I make? leveraging server-side state management tool to code the authentication, so boilerplate code can be reduced, (this still needs
    further discussions)
- 20 May - 21 May
  - What went well?: styling, cart functionalities
  - What went wrong?: multi-step forms can't be handled by form library
    and its associated libraries due to multi-stage submission
  - What changes can I make? handling multi-step form submission in the backend (but it takes a lot of time to design the backend logics); focusing on the core
    business logics rather than handling forms
