## Overview of Migrating Local Docker Compose Deployment to ECS

### Assumptions

- The multi-container app is already deployed locally using `docker compose up --build -d`, and the images for each component have been built successfully.
- A **VPC is ready**, as Fargate will be used as the launch type, which requires a VPC for task networking.
- Security groups are already configured as part of the VPC setup.
- IAM roles are automatically created and managed by AWS during the task definition process.
- ECR access is established prior to pushing images to ECR.

### Indicative Process for Transitioning Local Docker Compose to Microservices on AWS ECS

1. **Push Images to ECR**: For each component, push the Docker images to their respective Amazon ECR repositories, aligning the image tagging with the versioning strategy.

2. **Create ECS Cluster**: Set up an ECS cluster within the existing VPC.

3. **Create ECS Task Definitions**: Define separate ECS task definitions for each component, referencing the appropriate image URI from ECR. Specify resource requirements and networking settings.

4. **Create ECS Services**: Set up services for the task definitions (database, backend API, frontend web server) within the ECS cluster.

5. **Configure Networking**:

   - Set up networking settings for communication between containers.
   - Ensure the backend can connect to the database on port 3306.
   - Using the `awsvpc` network mode allows each task to have its own elastic network interface, providing unique IP addresses within the VPC.

6. **Purchase Domain**: After services are operational and communicating, purchase a domain for the frontend web server. Update the Caddyfile and rebuild the web server service image accordingly.
