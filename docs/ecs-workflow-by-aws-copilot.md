## Estimate of Using AWS Copilot CLI for ECS Migration (without Load Balancing and Public Domain Considerations)

The following sections give estimate of using AWS Copilot CLI to migrate to ECS deployment, ignoring load balancing and public domain aspects, (A public IP address would suffice, though I'm unsure how the ECS ecosystem exposes a service to a public address. I mentioned the public IP because EC2 instances can be configured to have one attached).

### Assumptions

- Multi-container application is locally deployed using a `compose.yaml` file to orchestrate the database, backend, and frontend services, running fine on localhost port 80, and is working as intended.
- Has provisioned their VPC through Terraform, along with several security groups (for inbound HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and NFS traffic, with all allowing outbound traffic), 2 EFS file systems (both allow inbound NFS traffic, using one of the security groups), and 1 RDS instance with a custom DB subnet group that includes all private subnets. All resources provisioned by Terraform can be easily destroyed or reapplied based on future use cases.
- Prefers to use RDS for faster deployment, even though it might be changed to using VPC endpoints with an ECS database service later, as the cost difference is just about 7-8 dollars per month. The provisioning and destruction of RDS using Terraform have been automated, which is another reason to use RDSâ€”if it doesn't work well in the future, the RDS instance can easily destroy it and later switch to using VPC endpoints with an ECS database service.

### Indicative Process for AWS Copilot CLI Migration

1. **Initialize Copilot**:

   - Command: `copilot init`
   - Define the application name and choose the service type (e.g., "Load Balanced Web Service" or "Backend Service").
   - Specify the path to the Dockerfile.

2. **Service Creation**:

   - Use `copilot svc init` for each service (backend, frontend, and database) to define the service configurations.
   - Specify the Docker images and relevant environment variables.
   - **Do not initialize a service for the database.** Since RDS is used, this step only applies to the backend and frontend.

3. **Environment Setup**:

   - Command: `copilot env init`
   - Define the environment (e.g., development or production).
   - Choose the VPC and subnets for deployment (select existing ones if available).

4. **Modify Backend Service Configuration**:

   - Configure the backend service to connect to the RDS instance:
     - Set up environment variables for database connection parameters (RDS endpoint, port, username, password, etc.).
     - Ensure that the backend service's security group allows outbound traffic to the RDS instance.
     - Ensure that the RDS security group allows inbound traffic from the backend's security group on the necessary database port (usually port 3306 for MySQL).

5. **Deploy Services**:

   - Command: `copilot deploy`
   - Deploy each service to the specified environment.
   - AWS Copilot will manage creating ECS task definitions, roles, and necessary infrastructure.

6. **Testing**:
   - After deployment, test the application using the provided public IP address.
   - Verify that the multi-container setup is functioning as expected.

### Additional Considerations

- **ECR Integration**: Ensure Docker images are pushed to ECR, as Copilot will pull from ECR during deployment.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure any necessary environment variables for the services in Copilot.
- **Database Configuration**: Verify that the RDS instance is correctly referenced in the backend service configuration.

### Estimated Timeframe

- **Initialization & Setup**: 1-2 hours
- **Service Configuration**: 2-3 hours
- **Deployment**: 1 hour
- **Testing & Debugging**: 1-2 hours

**Total Estimate**: Approximately **5-8 hours**, depending on complexity and any issues encountered during deployment.
